# Infinite Bargaining Simulation

This project is an interactive **bargaining simulation** inspired by evolutionary game theory. The simulation models how strategies evolve over time – through mutation and selection – when haggling over a divisible prize. 

## **How It Works**
- Agents are **haggling** over a prize.
- Two agents are **randomly selected** from the population.
- Each agent **demands** a share of a prize.
- If the sum of their demands is **more than** the total prize, then they both get **nothing**.
- Otherwise, they **get what they demand**, and reproduce based on their success.
- Each new generation **inherits demand strategies** from their parents, with some probability of mutation.
  - When a mutation occurs, the demand value changes by a random amount up to the mutation amount. (For example, a mutation rate of .10 means that there is a 10% chance of a mutation in the demand of a random anount up to 10% of the prize total.)
- The chart (histogram) shows the **number of agents** making each demand.
- The **'rolling median'** demand from the previous ten rounds is shown below.
- The results of the simulation show that a **sense of fairness** evolves spontaneously in bargaining situations; agents tend to demand (just under) half the prize.

## **Features**
✅ **Interactive Controls**:
- **Adjust Prize Size**: Controls the total amount available for bargaining.
- **Adjust Mutation Rate**: Modifies how frequently demand strategies mutate.
- **Adjust Population Size**: Tests how population size affects evolution.
- **Start/Stop Simulation Button**: Lets you control when to run or pause.

✅ **Visual Evolution Tracking**:
- **Live Strategy Distribution Graph**: Displays the frequency of different demand strategies.

✅ **Optimized Performance**:
- Updates every **10 frames** to improve performance.
